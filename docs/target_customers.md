## Target Customer Playbook

### 1. Direct-to-Consumer (B2C)
- **Ideal Profiles:**
  - Dual-career parents managing school pickups and extracurriculars.
  - Adult children coordinating with aging parents who still drive.
  - Couples navigating long commutes or irregular shift work.
- **Key Pain Points:** Constant “Where are you?” texts, anxiety when loved ones are late, juggling multiple communication threads across devices.
- **Value Proposition:** Hands-free, scheduled updates with map + ETA on TV and voice assistants reduce coordination friction and create calm.
- **Competitive Edge:** Unlike Life360 or Google Family Link, HorizonLink delivers passive TV/voice experiences, configurable sharing schedules, and privacy-first pause controls.
- **Financial Impact:** Saves ~14 minutes/day per household (≈85 hours/year). At an average hourly value of $25, families recoup ~$2,125/year in time saved—over 30× ROI on the $69 annual plan.

### 2. Business-to-Business (B2B)
- **Ideal Profiles:**
  - Home-health agencies and senior living facilities needing visit verification.
  - Field-service teams (HVAC, maintenance) coordinating dispersed technicians.
  - Non-emergency medical transport and paratransit operators.
- **Key Pain Points:** Manual check-in calls, compliance penalties for late arrivals, lack of real-time visibility for coordinators and families.
- **Value Proposition:** Central console with automated schedules, real-time dashboards, compliance exports, and broadcast updates to family stakeholders.
- **Competitive Edge:** Faster deployment than legacy EVV suites, richer multi-device output (TV displays in care facilities, voice prompts for staff), and API hooks for existing CRMs.
- **Financial Impact:** Eliminating two coordination calls per visit (5 minutes each) for 50 daily visits saves ~8.3 staff hours/day → ~$60K annual labor savings, dwarfing the $1,188/year Starter subscription.

### 3. Business-to-Business-to-Consumer (B2B2C)
- **Ideal Profiles:**
  - Airport shuttle or luxury rideshare fleets wanting premium concierge experiences.
  - School transportation coordinators providing peace-of-mind to parents.
  - Concierge residential services and gated communities needing arrival visibility.
- **Key Pain Points:** Customer uncertainty about pickup timing, high inbound inquiries, and differentiation challenges in competitive mobility markets.
- **Value Proposition:** Co-branded apps + TV/voice dashboards deliver live ETAs directly to riders’ families, reducing support volume and elevating brand trust.
- **Competitive Edge:** Ready-made white-label module, voice skill templates, and revenue-sharing upgrades set HorizonLink apart from standard dispatch tools.
- **Financial Impact:** Cutting inbound “Where is my driver?” calls by 40% for a 25-vehicle fleet (assuming 2 minutes/call and $20/hour dispatcher cost) saves ~$16K/year, offsetting the $5,988 annual platform fee while unlocking upsell revenue.

  - Smart-home retailers bundling peace-of-mind solutions.
  - Insurance carriers seeking safe-driving engagement perks.
