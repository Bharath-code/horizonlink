- **TAM (global location-based services, consumer safety segment):** ~$35B in 2024 growing at ~18% CAGR (Statista, MarketsandMarkets); assume 15% addressable for family-safety = ~$5.3B.
- **SAM (smartphone + smart-display households in US/EU, middle-income+):** ~72M households × $60 expected annual ARPU ≈ $4.3B.
- **SOM (bootstrap attainable in 3 years):** Capture 0.05% of SAM ≈ 36K paying households → ~$2.2M ARR.

## Customer Willingness & Validation

- Families already paying for Life360 ($14.99/mo), Google One Safety ($9.99/mo), vehicle telematics; indicates willingness to pay for trusted, privacy-focused alternatives.
- Pain points: coordination fatigue (constant texting), need for elder monitoring without complex hardware, multi-device consumption (TV/voice assistants).
- Validation tactics: 30-customer discovery interviews, concierge pilot with 50 families via TestFlight/closed beta, landing page with value prop A/B tests.

## Revenue Model & Pricing

- **Free tier:** 1 shared location, 6-hour history, manual refresh, ads off; used for viral growth.
- **Premium (recommended):** $6.99/mo or $69/yr per household → unlimited members, automation schedules, geofencing alerts, voice assistant integration, ETA history.
- **Add-ons:** $2/mo for extended history (30 days), $5/mo for caregiver compliance reports.
- **Bootstrap cashflow:** Aim for CAC < $12; break-even with 2-month customer lifetime.

## Marketing Strategy

1. **Positioning:** “Hands-free peace of mind for families who coordinate across phones, TVs, and smart speakers.” Focus on ease, privacy, passive updates.
2. **Acquisition channels:**
   - Content & SEO: safety guides, elder care coordination tips.
   - Partnerships: senior living communities, rideshare driver forums, family bloggers.
   - Paid: narrow Facebook/Instagram lookalike audiences; retargeting to capture intent.
   - App Store Optimization: emphasize TV/voice integrations.
3. **Growth loops:** Referral credits, family onboarding flows, shareable ETA links.
4. **Community programs:** Monthly webinars on safety tech, user advisory panel.

## Sales Strategy

- **Self-serve funnel:** Landing page → free tier signup → in-app upgrade prompts tied to automation/geofence features.
- **B2B2C pilots:** Offer white-label dashboards for elder-care agencies and gig-economy fleets; charge $99/mo for 20 seats.
- **Direct outreach:** Founder-led email campaigns to daycare centers, small transport services.
- **Key metrics:** Activation rate (paired receiver within 48h), WAU/MAU, conversion to premium (goal 12% in 6 months), churn <4% monthly.

## Financial Targets (Bootstrap Year 1)

- Pre-launch: $5K budget for landing page + ads + testing.
- Month 6: 2K free households, 180 premium (LTV $150, CAC $10) → $1.2K MRR.
- Month 12: 1.2K premium subscribers, $8.4K MRR, 35% gross margin after infrastructure.

## Risk & Mitigation

- **Competition:** Differentiate via cross-device experience and privacy; file for SOC2/ISO roadmap early.
- **Retention risk:** Build habit loops (daily digest, TV status widget).
- **Regulatory:** Comply with GDPR/CCPA, explicit consent flows.
